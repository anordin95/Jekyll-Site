I'll be spending the next year working under Kalyan Veeramachaneni at the Data to AI Lab at MIT. Two years ago, a student wrote a thesis detailing a language to formally define prediction problems. In the coming year I'll extend his work and build out a fully functioning system to generate prediction problems from a given dataset.

Abstract:

Machine learning has seen a swell of activity in recent years. Many applications of machine learning involve industry-specific tasks where acquired data is leveraged to build classifiers that can better predict events. Today we have an abundance of data and a need for more machine learning experts to perform analysis and derive insights. Weâ€™ll call data analysis the process of a machine learning expert analyzing data. One major impediment to the data analysis process is coming up with relevant prediction problems that can be answered with the data. We propose a system that can automatically generate prediction problems. Incorporating our technology into the data analysis process will greatly reduce the barrier to entry for understanding and advantageously using machine learning for data scientists and laymen.

Here's the full thesis proposal:
