I spent 7 weeks performing neuroscience research with Geoffrey Goodhill and his team at the Queensland Brain Institute. The team had recently collected a dataset with neural information about zebrafish. The zebrafish dataset contained precise information about activation levels of every indivudal neuron in the zebrafish's brain. We used this data to investigate spatial and temporal relationships within the zebrafish brain. Through in-depth, rigorous analysis I discovered no significant temporal relationship in zebrafish's brain activity.

Here's a full report on my work:
